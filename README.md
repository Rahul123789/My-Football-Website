# My-Football-Website

This is a website of me talking about Football.
Web Programming with Python and CSS

In my website I created the first page about me talking about my interset which is Soccer (Football). 
In each .html file page I have created a index at the bottom of the page to indicate what is on each page and what to click to get to the pages. 
Also on each page I have created at the top of the a navigation bar with each page linked on it, which will take you to the page when clicked. 
The first page is called the home page, the second page is called Index 1 page which I talk about my top 5 favourite soccer players, and I have used a orderd list to tell it. 
In the 3 page which is called Index 2 page, I used a table to show the top 3 most expensive soccer players. The last page is called Index 3 page which is where I use a image and show you a picture of my favourite player.
